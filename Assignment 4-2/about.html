  <h2>Why is Philippines my favorite place?</h2>
    <p>The Philippines is dear to my heart because this is where I was born. I grew up in manila, and moved to the United States when I was 14. Philippines has taught me alot about life. Living in the Philippines taught me that happiness does not come from money, its what you make it. </p>
